# Machine Learning Handwritten Number Analyzer

**Starter project for understanding basic machine learning structure and algorithms**

### Lessons learned
- Fundamental concepts like weights and biases
- Forward propagation (matrix multiplication, transposition and activation functions like sigmoid and relu)
- Backward propagation (derivatives and chain rule)
- Weight updating using the derivative calculations
- Gradient building using Mini-Batch gradients

### How to run
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
